<blockquote style='font-size:0.9em;'>The reappearance of Olafson, the violinist,
who had gone out in the blizzard and was lost seeking the north wind
that he might learn the song it sang, and who, according to Happy Jack,
returned to earth on moonlight nights to play his violin in the doorway
of the deserted shack in One Man Coulee.</blockquote>

<p>Happy Jack, by some freak of misguided
ambition, was emulating rather heavily the elfish imagination of Andy
Green. He was&#8212;to put it baldly and colloquially&#8212;throwing a big load
into the Native Son who jingled his gorgeous silver spurs close
alongside Happy’s more soberly accoutered heel.</p>

<p>“That there,” Happy was saying, with ponderous gravity, “is the shack
where the old fiddler went crazy trying to play a tune like the wind&#8212;or
some blamed fool thing like that&#8212;and killed himself because he couldn’t
make it stick. It’s haunted, that shack is. The old fellow’s ghost comes
around there moonlight nights and plays the fiddle in the door.”</p>

<p>The Native Son, more properly christened Miguel, turned a languidly
velvet glance toward the cabin and flicked the ashes from his cigarette
daintily. “Have you ever seen the ghost, Happy?” he asked indulgently.</p>

<p>“Ah&#8212;yes, sure! I seen it m’self,” Happy lied boldly.</p>

<p>“And were you scared?”</p>

<p>“Me? Scared? Hunh!” Happy gave a fairly good imitation of dumb disgust.
“Why, I went and&#8212;”</p>

<p>Happy’s imagination floundered in the stagnant pool of a slow-thinking
brain.</p>

<p>“I went right in and&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Exactly.” Miguel smiled a smile of even, white teeth and ironical lips.
“Some moonlight night we will come back here at midnight, you and I. I
have heard of that man, and I am fond of music. We will come and listen
to him.”</p>

<p>Some of the other boys, ambling up from behind, caught a part of the
speech, and looked at one another, grinning.</p>

<p>“The Native Son’s broke out all over with schoolbook grammar ag’in,” Big
Medicine remarked. “Wonder what Happy’s done? I’ve noticed, by cripes,
that the guilty party better duck, when that there Miguel begins to talk
like a schoolma’am huntin’ a job! Hey, there!” he bellowed suddenly, so
that one might hear him half a mile away. “What’s this here music talk I
hear? Who’s goin’ to play, and where at, and how much is it a head?”</p>

<p>Miguel turned and looked back at the group, smiling still. “Happy was
telling me about a ghost in that cabin down there.” He flung out a hand
toward the place so suddenly that his horse jumped in fear of the quirt.
“I say we’ll come back some night and listen to the ghost. Happy says he
frequently rides over to hear it play on moonlight nights, and&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Aw, g’wan!” Happy Jack began to look uncomfortable in his mind. “I
said&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Happy? If he thought there was a ghost in One Man Coulee, you couldn’t
tie him down and haul him past in a hayrack at noon,” Andy asserted
sharply. “There isn’t any ghost.”</p>

<p>Andy set his lips firmly together, and stared reminiscently down the
hill at the lonely little cabin in the coulee. Memory, the original
moving-picture machine, which can never be equaled by any man-made
contrivance, flashed upon him vividly a picture of the night when he had
sat within that cabin, listening to the man who would play the north
wind, and who wept because it eluded him always; who played
wonderfully&#8212;a genius gone mad under the spell of his own music&#8212;and at
last rushed out into the blizzard and was lost, seeking the north wind
that he might learn the song it sang. The scene gripped Andy, even in
memory. He wondered fancifully if Olafson was still wandering with his
violin, searching for the home of the north wind. They had never found
him, not even when the snows had gone and the land lay bare beneath a
spring sky. He must have frozen, for the night had been bitter, and a
blizzard raged blindingly. Still, they had never found a trace of him.</p>

<p>There had been those who, after searching a while in vain, had accused
Andy to his face of building the story to excite his fellows. He had
been known to deceive his friends heartlessly, and there had been some
argument over the real fate of the vanished Olafson. If Andy had told
the truth, asked the doubters, where was Olafson’s body? And who had
ever tried to play the wind? Who, save Andy Green, would ever think of
such a fantastic tale? Happy Jack, Andy remembered resentfully, had been
unusually vociferous in his unbelief, even for him.</p>

<p>“Aw, you stuck to it there was all the makin’s of a ghost,” Happy
defended awkwardly, and wished that Andy Green had not overheard the
yarn he told Miguel. “Sure, there’s a ghost!” He fell back a step that
he might wink at Big Medicine, and so enlist his sledge-hammer
assistance. “I leave it to Bud if we didn’t hear it, one night&#8212;-”</p>

<p>“And seen it, too, by cripes!” Big Medicine enlarged readily and
shamelessly. “Standin’ right in the door, playin’ the fiddle to beat a
straight flush.” He glared around the little group with his protruding
eyes until his glance met the curious look of Cal Emmett. “You was with
us, Cal,” he asserted boldly. “I leave it to you if we didn’t see ’im
and hear ’im.”</p>

<p>Cal, thus besought to bear false witness, did so with amiable alacrity.
“We sure did,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Funny you never said a word about it before,” snapped Andy, with open
disbelief in his tone.</p>

<p>“We thought nobody’d believe us if we did tell it,” Big Medicine
explained.</p>

<p>“Pity yuh don’t always think as close to the mark as yuh done then,”
Andy retorted.</p>

<p>“How do yuh know there ain’t a ghost?” Big Medicine demanded with some
slight rancor, born not of the argument, but of temporary ill feeling
between the two. “Is it because yuh know, by cripes, that yuh lied last
winter?”</p>

<p>Andy’s lips tightened. “I’ve heard about enough of that,” he said, with
a flash of anger. With the cabin in sight, and recalling the tragedy of
that night, he was not in the mood to wrangle good-naturedly about it
with any one&#8212;least of all with Big Medicine. “I didn’t lie. I’m dead
willing to back what I said about it with my fists, if&#8212;”</p>

<p>Big Medicine twitched the reins to ride close, but Miguel’s horse sidled
suddenly and blocked the move. Also, Miguel smiled guilelessly into the
angry eyes of Big Medicine.</p>

<p>“Will you fellows come back with me to-night, then, and see the ghost?”
he asked lightly. “Or don’t you dare tackle it again?”</p>

<p>Big Medicine snorted and forgot his immediate intentions toward Andy,
just as Miguel, perhaps, intended that he should do.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t dast come along, if we did,” he glowered. “I’d camp there
alone for a month, far as I’m concerned, if there was any grub, by
cripes!”</p>

<p>“That shows how much you know about the place,” put in Pink, siding with
Andy. “Unless somebody’s packed it away lately, there’s all kinds of
grub left. Maybe the flour, and bacon, and beans is gone, but there’s
enough pickles and stuffed olives to last&#8212;”</p>

<p>“<em>Olives!</em>” cried the Native Son, and looked
back longingly at the rugged bluff which marked One Man Coulee. “Say,
does anybody belong to them olives?”</p>

<p>“Nobody but the ghost,” grinned Pink. “We bought him twelve lovely tall
bottles, just to please Jimmie; he told us there wasn’t any sale for
stuffed olives in Dry Lake, and he offered ’em to us at cost. We did
think uh taking all he had, but we cut it down to twelve bottles
afterward. And Olafson never ate a darned olive all the time he was
there!”</p>

<p>“And they’re there yet, you say?” It was plain that Miguel was far more
interested in the olives than he was in the ghost.</p>

<p>“Sure, they’re there.” Pink was not troubling to warp the truth, as
Miguel decided, after a sharp glance. “The stuff all belonged to
Olafson, and the shack belongs to the Old Man. And when Olafson went
crazy over the wind, and froze to death,” he stipulated distinctly, with
a challenging glance at Big Medicine, “we all kept thinking at first
he’d come back, maybe. But he never did&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Exceptin’ his ghost, by golly!” put in Slim unexpectedly, with a
belated snort of amusement at the idea.</p>

<p>“I’d rather,” sighed Miguel, “have a dozen bottles of stuffed olives
than a dozen kisses from the prettiest girl in the State.”</p>

<p>“Mamma! they’re easier to get, anyway. If you want ’em that bad&#8212;”</p>

<p>“That there ghost may have something to say about them olives,” Happy
Jack warned, sticking stubbornly to his story.</p>

<p>Miguel smiled&#8212;and there was that in his smile which sent four
mendacious cow-punchers hot with resentment.</p>

<p>“Maybe yuh don’t <em>believe</em> in that ghost, by cripes?” Big Medicine
challenged indignantly, and gave Miguel a pale, pop-eyed stare meant to
be intimidating.</p>

<p>Miguel smiled again as at some secret joke, and made no reply at all.</p>

<p>“Well&#8212;don’t yuh <em>b’lieve</em> it?” Big Medicine roared after a minute.</p>

<p>Miguel smiled gently and inspected his cigarette; emotions might surge
about this Native Son and beat themselves to a white froth upon the rock
of his absolute, inimitable imperturbability, as the Happy Family knew
well. Now they rode close-grouped, intensely interested in this struggle
between bull-bellowing violence and languid impassivity.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe it yourself, do you?” Miguel inquired evenly at last,
rousing himself from his abstraction. “Did you expect me to swallow
hook, sinker, and all?”</p>

<p>Big Medicine looked positively murderous. “When I say a thing is so,” he
cried, “I expect, by cripes, that folks will take m’ bare word for it. I
don’t have to produce no affidavies, nor haul in any witnesses. I ain’t
like Andy, here. You’re dealin’ now with a man that can look truth in
the face and never bat an eye.”</p>

<p>Miguel smiled again, this time more humanly amused. “I’ve met men before
who hadn’t a speaking acquaintance with Dame Truth,” he drawled. “They
looked her in the face, too&#8212;and she never recognized ’em.”</p>

<p>Big Medicine was at that critical point where make-believe may easily
become reality. He had been “joshing” and playing he was mad before; now
his glare hardened perceptibly, so that more than one of the boys
noticed the difference.</p>

<p>“Aw, if he don’t want to believe it he don’t have to,” Happy Jack
intercepted Big Medicine’s belligerent speech. “Chances is them
olives’ll stay where they’re at a good long while, though&#8212;if Mig-u-ell
has to get ’em after dark.”</p>

<p>Miguel smoked while he rode ten rods. “I offered to come and listen to
the ghost fiddle his fastest,” he observed at last, “and not one of you
fellows took me up on it. To-night I’ll come alone and get those olives.
I guess I can carry twelve bottles all right.”</p>

<p>“It’s no use to-night,” Cal Emmett objected. “It’s only on moonlight
nights&#8212;” He looked a question at Big Medicine.</p>

<p>“Moonlight it’s got to be. There ain’t a moon till&#8212;”</p>

<p>“I can find stuffed olives any old kind of a night.” Miguel blew the
ashes from his cigarette. “It’s the olives I want, amigo. I don’t give a
whoop for your ghost.”</p>

<p>“Aw, I betche yuh dassent come when it’s moonlight, just the same,”
cried Happy Jack. “I betche ten dollars yuh <em>dassent</em>.”</p>

<p>It would be tiresome to repeat all that was said upon the subject
thereafter. So slight a thing as Happy Jack’s wrongful desire to lie as
convincingly as could Andy Green, led the whole Happy Family into a
profitless and more or less acrimonious argument. Each man, according to
his nature, and the mood he happened to be in at the moment, took up the
discussion. And speedily it developed that the faction against Miguel,
Andy Green, and Pink included every man of them save Weary, who would
stand by Pink regardless of the issue.</p>

<p>It was nearly noon, and they were hungry, and headed toward camp; but
despite their haste they argued the foolish question of whether the
cabin in One Man Coulee was haunted. Six of them maintained stubbornly
that it was&#8212;for Irish began to side with Happy Jack just because he did
not like the Native Son very well, and that ironical smile of Miguel’s
irritated him to a degree; and Jack Bates also espoused the ghost
because he scented an opportunity for excitement. The minority, composed
of Miguel, Pink, Andy Green, and Weary, confined themselves largely to
sarcasm&#8212;which is the oil which feeds fastest the flames of dissension.</p>

<p>It was foolish, to be sure; just as foolish as many other things which
men drift into doing. But they, nevertheless, reached that point where,
as in the case of Big Medicine, make-believe crowded close upon reality.
The four rode together into camp ten paces ahead of the six, and they
talked in low tones among themselves mostly. When they did deign to look
at the six, their glances were unfriendly, and when they spoke their
speech was barbed so that it stung the listeners. And the six retaliated
vigorously&#8212;the more so because they had been silly enough in the first
place to declare their belief in the nonexistent, and had been betrayed
into making many ridiculous assertions which they were too obstinate to
withdraw; so that once again the Happy Family belied the name men had
given it, and became for the time being a bunch of as disagreeable
cow-punchers as one could find in four days’ ride.</p>

<p>“Aw, say, I sure would like to put it on them fellers <em>good</em>!”
Happy Jack growled to Cal and Jack Bates on the way to the corralled
saddle bunch after dinner. Happy Jack was purple with wrath, for a
caustic sentence or two spoken in Miguel’s most maddening drawl was yet
stinging his ears. “That there Native Son makes me <em>tired</em>! I
wisht there <em>was</em> a ghost&#8212;I’d sure&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s a ghost, all right,” Jack Bates stated meaningly; “all yuh
got to do is make one.”</p>

<p>“Say, by golly!” Slim, close behind them, gulped excitedly. “Wouldn’t
it&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Say, don’t let them faces get to leaking,” Cal advised bluntly. “It’s a
whole week till the moon’s good. Shut up!”</p>

<p>Slim goggled at him, caught the hazy beginning of an idea, grinned, and
stepped over the rope into the corral. He was grinning when he caught
his horse, and he was still grinning widely while he cinched the saddle.
He caught Andy Green eying him suspiciously, and snickered outright. But
he did not say a word, and, therefore, went his way, believing that he
had given no hint of what was in his mind.</p>

<p>Slim and Happy Jack were alike in one respect: Their minds worked slowly
and rather ponderously&#8212;and, like other ponderous machinery, once in
motion they were hard to stop. The others would have left the subject
alone, after that hour of hot argument, and in time would have forgotten
it except for an occasional jeer, perhaps; but not so Happy Jack and
Slim.</p>

<p>The Flying U outfit ate, saddled fresh horses, reloaded the mess wagon,
and moved on toward Dry Creek, and that night flung weary bodies upon
the growing grass in the shade of the tents, twenty miles and more from
One Man Coulee and the little cabin with its grim history of genius
blotted out in madness. Nevertheless, Slim searched ostentatiously with
plate, knife, and fork in his hand, at supper time, and craned his neck
over boxes and cans, until he had the attention of his fellows, who were
hungry, and elbowed him out of their way with scant courtesy.</p>

<p>“Say, Mig-u-ell, where’s them stuffed olives?” he called at last. “I
thought, by golly, we was goin’ to have some olives for supper?”</p>

<p>“Olives&#8212;<em>stuffed</em> olives, are best picked by moonlight, they tell me,”
Miguel responded unemotionally, glancing up over his cup. “Have
patience, amigo.”</p>

<p>Slim nudged Happy Jack so that he spilled half his coffee and swore
because it was hot, caught Big Medicine’s pale-eyed glare upon him, and
subsided so suddenly that he choked over his next sentence, which had
nothing at all to do with olives, or ghosts, or insane fiddlers.</p>

<p>Men, it would seem, never quite leave their boyhood behind them; at
least, those men do not who live naturally and individually, untainted
by the poison of the great money marts where human nature is warped and
perverted so that nearly all natural instincts are subordinated to the
lust for gain of one sort and another. In the Bear Paw country men labor
for gain, it is true; but they also live the lives for which nature has
created them. There is that in the wide reaches of plain and valley, in
the clean arch of blue sky and drifting clouds overhead, which keeps the
best of them boyish till their temples are marked with white&#8212;yes, and
after.</p>

<p>It was that tenacious element which started Irish, Cal Emmett, Jack
Bates, and Big Medicine to tilting hat brims together when none others
were near observe them. It was that which sent them off riding by
themselves&#8212;to town, they said before they started&#8212;early on the first
Sunday after the wagons had pulled in to the ranch, there to stand until
the beef round-up started.</p>

<p>They returned unobtrusively by mid-afternoon, and they looked very well
satisfied with themselves, and inclined to facetiousness.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Weary asked them pointedly when they dismounted at
the corral. “Come back after something you forgot?”</p>

<p>“Yeah&#8212;sure,” Cal returned, with a flicker of eyelids. “Nothing doing in
that darned imitation of a town, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the mail?” Pink demanded expectantly.</p>

<p>“We&#8212;plumb forgot that there mail, by cripes!” Big Medicine looked up
quickly. “Irish was goin’ to git it, but he didn’t.”</p>

<p>Pink said nothing, but he studied the four from under the long, curled
lashed which he had found very useful in concealing covert glances.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Little One&#8212;honest to grandma, I am!” Big Medicine clapped him
patronizingly on the shoulder as he passed him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as it matters,” said Pink sweetly. “Some of us were just
about ready to hit the trail. We can get it, I guess. Say! Ain’t you got
that cayuse caught up yet, Mig?” he called out to the Native Son, who
was reclining luxuriously against a new stack of sweet-smelling
bluejoint hay. “Come out of your trance, or we’ll go off and leave you!”</p>

<p>“Oh&#8212;yuh going to town?” Cal looked over his shoulder with some
uneasiness in his baby-blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Maybe we are and maybe we ain’t. Maybe we’re going to see our best
girls. What’s it <em>to</em> you?” Pink turned his back on Cal and looked full
at Weary. “Come on&#8212;the girls will be plumb wild if we don’t get a move
on,” he said carelessly, and picked up his bridle. “Where’s Andy? I
thought he said he wanted to go along. Hurry up, Mig, if you’re going.”</p>

<p>Nobody knew what he was driving at, but the three were mounted well
within ten minutes, and flinging back remarks to the four who had lately
returned. The departing ones were well up on the hogback before any one
of them ventured to question Pink, who rode with the air of one whose
destination is fixed, and whose desire outstrips his body in the
journey.</p>

<p>“Say, Cadwolloper, where are we headed for?” Weary inquired then
resignedly. “And what’s the rush?”</p>

<p>Pink glanced down the hill toward the stable and corrals, decided that
they were being observed with something very like suspicion, and faced
to the front again. “We’re going to <em>head</em> for Rogers’,” he dimpled,
“but we ain’t going to get there. Yuh needn’t look down there&#8212;but Irish
and Cal are saddling up again. They’re afraid we’re going to town.
They’re going to trail us up and find out for sure.”</p>

<p>“They sure did act like they’d been holding up a train, when they rode
up,” Weary observed. “I’ve been searching my soul with a spyglass trying
to find the answer for all that guilt on their faces.”</p>

<p>“Happy Jack has been mentioning stuffed olives and moonlight pretty
often to-day,” the Native Son remarked with apparent irrelevance. “I
thought he’d pickled that josh, but he’s working things up again. Two
and two make four; <em>that</em> four.” With the slightest of head tilts he
indicated those below, and flashed his even, white teeth in a smile. “Do
you want me to guess where you’re going, Pink?”</p>

<p>“I wish you fellows would guess how we’re going to ditch them two
pirates, first,” Pink retorted, glancing down again at the stable
without turning his head. “If we strike straight for Rogers’, maybe
they’ll turn back, though. They’ll think we’ve gone over there to see
the girls.”</p>

<p>“If I knew the country a little better&#8212;” began the Native Son, and
stopped with that.</p>

<p>“If they don’t follow us over the ridge,” spoke up Andy, who had been
thinking deeply, “we can go up Antelope Coulee instead of down, and
follow along in the edge of the breaks to the head of One Man, and down
that; that’s where you’re going, isn’t it? It will be five or six miles
farther.”</p>

<p>Pink threw up his hand impatiently. “Uh course, that’s what I intended
to do. But if they ride over the ridge they’ll know we never kept
straight on to Rogers’, and then they’ll know we’re dodging.” He urged
his horse up the last steep slope, and led the way over the brow of the
bluff and out of sight of the ranch below. “And I’m sure going to find
out what that bunch has been making themselves so mysterious about, the
last couple uh days,” he vowed grimly. “I slipped up on ’em yesterday
down in the hay corral, and I heard Cal say, ‘Sure, we can! There’s one
in that Injun grave over in Antelope Coulee.’” He stared at the others
with purpling eyes. “What’s in that grave, Weary? I never was right to
it, myself.”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Cadwolloper&#8212;except what is left of the old boy they tucked
under that ledge. There ain’t even a <em>per</em>fume any more. We can go by
that way and see if they’ve been there.”</p>

<p>With that wordless understanding common among men who have lived long
together, they left the trail and ambled slowly across the prairie in
the direction of the Rogers Ranch. And they had not traveled more than
half a mile when Miguel, looking back very cautiously, smiled.</p>

<p>“Don’t look,” he said, and then added melodramatically: “We are
followed! Hist! The pursuers are in sight. Courage, men!”</p>

<p>Pink risked a glance over his shoulder, and glimpsed two bobbing hat
crowns just over the brow of Flying U Coulee.</p>

<p>“Now, wouldn’t that jar yuh?” he exclaimed, just as disgustedly as if he
had not all along suspected that very thing to happen.</p>

<p>The moving specks stopped, remained stationary for a minute or two, and
then went bobbing back again. The four laughed, pressed spurred heels
against their horses, and galloped over the ridge and into the lower end
of Antelope Coulee. At the bottom they swung sharply to the right,
instead of to the left, rode as hurriedly as the uneven ground would
permit for a mile or more; crossed the trail to Dry Lake, and kept on up
the coulee to its very head.</p>

<p>At one point their quick eyes saw where several horsemen had ridden down
into the coulee, dismounted, and climbed through shale rock to the lone
Indian grave under a low shelf of sandstone, left there betraying
imprints of high-heeled boots, returned again to where their horses had
waited, and ridden on. They also rode on, toward One Man Coulee. Before
them always lay the trail of shod hoofs, where the soil was not too hard
to receive an imprint.</p>

<p>Patsy was standing in the door of the mess house beating his fat
knuckles upon a tin pan for the supper call, when Andy Green and Miguel
rode leisurely down the grade. The boys were straggling toward the
sound, and there was the usual bustle around the washbasins and roller
towels, and in the quiet air hung the enticing odor of Patsy’s
delectable chicken potpie. The two hurried to the stable, unsaddled with
the haste of hungry men, and reached the mess house just as the clatter
of feet had subsided and the potpie was making its first round.</p>

<p>Cal looked up from a generous helping. “Hello, where’s the rest of the
bunch?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Oh, the girls have got them roped and tied,” Andy responded carelessly.
“Mig and I got cold feet, and broke back on them.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t yuh go to town?” Irish spoke as innocently as if he had not
watched them well on their way from the shelter of the bluff.</p>

<p>Miguel deigned him one of his heavy-lidded stares. “Why should one go
to town, when there are three pretty girls at the next ranch? Town
didn’t hold <em>you</em> fellows very long.”</p>

<p>“I thought sure you’d gone after olives, by golly,” blurted Slim, with
his mouth half full of dumpling.</p>

<p>“If I’d gone after them, I’d have got them,” Miguel, usually so
exasperatingly calm, spoke with some feeling.</p>

<p>“Aw, g’wan! I betche yuh <em>dassent</em> go.” Happy Jack grinned arrogantly.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t bet anything but words,” retorted Miguel. “There are
several of you fellows that seem to be just that brand of sports.” He
gave the faint shrug which they all hated.</p>

<p>Big Medicine laid down his knife and fork. “Say, do yuh mind naming over
them several fellers?” he inquired abruptly in his booming voice. “<em>I</em>
don’t bet words, by cripes&#8212;when I bet&#8212;”</p>

<p>Miguel smiled across at him blandly. “We were speaking of olives,” he
purred “Happy Jack wanted to ‘betche’ I daren’t go after them. He didn’t
name the stakes, though.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t because I ain’t willin’ to put ’em up,” glowered Happy. “I’ll
betche five dollars, then&#8212;if that suits yuh any better.”</p>

<p>Miguel laughed, which was unusual when he was arguing with any one. “Do
you mean it? Do you really think that little, weak, pretty-pretty ghost
story would scare&#8212;a&#8212;nigger baby?” His voice taunted the lot of them.</p>

<p>“Don’t yuh <em>believe</em> there’s a ghost, by cripes?” Big Medicine bawled
pugnaciously.</p>

<p>“No. Of course I don’t believe it. Neither do you.” Miguel spoke with
that weary tolerance which is so hard to endure.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> do,” Cal Emmett declared flatly. “And I’m willing to bet a horse
against them fancy spurs of yours that you dassent go to-night to One
Man Coulee and bring away them bottles of stuffed olives.”</p>

<p>“What horse?” asked Miguel, reaching for the chicken platter.</p>

<p>“Well&#8212;<em>any</em> darned horse I <em>own</em>!” Cal wore the open-eyed look of
innocence which had helped him scare out his opponents in many a poker
game. “I say to-night,” he added apologetically to the others, “because
it’s going to be clear and lots uh moonlight; and it’s Sunday. But I
don’t care <em>what</em> night he tries it. I’ll bet he won’t bring away no
<em>olives</em>.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they there?” Miguel wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Oh&#8212;they’re there, I guess. I’ll change the wordin’ a little. I’ll bet
yuh dassent go to that shack, and go into it and stay long enough to
freeze onto twelve bottles uh <em>anything</em>. To-night,” he added, “at
mid&#8212;no, any old time between ten and one. And I’ll bet any one uh my
four cayuses against your spurs.”</p>

<p>“It’s a go. Does the rest of my riding outfit look good to any of you
fellows?” Miguel glanced around the table smilingly. “Happy, for
instance&#8212;”</p>

<p>“I got five dollars up,” Happy Jack reminded. “But I’ll put twenty with
it against your bridle.”</p>

<p>“That bridle’s worth fifty dollars. And my saddle cost two hundred and
eighty. I’ll put them up, though, if any one wants to cover the bet.”</p>

<p>“Say, this is a shame. Honest to grandma, I’d hate to see Miggie ridin’
bareback the rest uh the summer&#8212;with a rope hackamore, by cripes! Don’t
go ’n take all his purty-purties away from him like that, boys!
Haw-haw-haw!” It is unwise to laugh like that with one’s mouth full of
chicken. Big Medicine choked and retired from the conversation and the
room.</p>

<p>“Say, you don’t reelize, by golly, what you’re up ag’inst,” Slim
observed ponderously. “If you did&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Are you dead-game sports, or are you a bunch of old women?” drawled
Miguel. “My outfit is up, if any one has nerve enough to take the bets.”</p>

<p>They wrangled more or less amicably over it, as was their habit. But
they did finally bet a great deal more on the foolish venture than they
should have done. When, finally, they reached the time and the point of
departure, Miguel, like the plains Indians during the fever of
horse-racing, was pledged to his hat and his high-heeled boots; while the
Happy Family, if they lost, would have plenty of reason to repent them
of their rashness.</p>

<p>They waited an hour for Pink and Weary to return, and, when they did not
appear, they rode off without them. They pitied Miguel, and told him so.
They told of haunted cabins, and of murders and dreams come true, and
of disasters that were weird.</p>

<p>Andy Green, when half of the ten miles had been covered, roused himself
from his disapproving silence and told them a fearsome tale of two
miners murdered mysteriously and thrown into their own mine, and of
their dog which howled up and down the mountain gulches when the
moonlight lay soft upon the land; told it so that they rode
close-huddled that they might catch it all, down to the last gruesomely
mysterious incident of the murdered master whistling from the pit to the
dog, and of the animal’s whimpering obedience&#8212;long years after, when
the dog’s bones were bleaching through sun and storm above, and the
master’s bones were rotting in the darkness below.</p>

<p>Happy Jack more than once glanced uneasily toward the shadowy hollows as
they rode slowly across the prairies through the night silence. Slim set
his jaw and rode stiffly, staring straight ahead of him as if he feared
what he might see, if he looked aside. Miguel was seen to shiver, though
the air was soft and warm.</p>

<p>“Now, this Olafson&#8212;” Andy began after a silence which no one thought to
break. “The boys joshed me a lot about that. But it was queer&#8212;the
queerest thing I ever saw or heard. To see him sitting there in the
firelight, listening&#8212;and while he listened, to hear the wind <em>whoo-whoo</em>
around the corners and down the chimney&#8212;and the snow <em>swish-swishing</em>
against the walls like grave clothes when the ghosts walk&#8212;”</p>

<p>“Aw&#8212;I thought yuh said there <em>wasn’t</em> any ghosts!” croaked Happy Jack
uneasily.</p>

<p>“And then Olafson would lift his violin and draw the bow across&#8212;”</p>

<p>Andy, the reins dropped upon the saddle horn, held an imaginary violin
cuddled under his chin, and across the phantom strings drew an imaginary
bow with slow, sweeping gestures, while his voice went on with the tale,
and the Happy Family watched, and listened, and saw what he meant them
to see. “And then would come that lonesome <em>whoo-oo</em> of the wind&#8212;from
the violin. He made me see things. He made me see the storm, like it was
a white spirit creeping over the range. He made me see&#8212;”</p>

<p>They had reached One Man Coulee while he talked. The Happy Family stared
down into the lonely place lying nakedly white under the moon, shivered,
and rode slowly down the slope. Like one in a trance Andy rode in their
midst, and compelled them with his voice to see the things he would have
them see. Compelled them to see Olafson, the master musician, striving
after the song of the north wind, and the prairie, and the wolf; made
them see him as he opened the door and stood there gazing wildly out,
playing&#8212;always playing&#8212;something weird and wonderful, and
supernaturally terrible.</p>

<p>“I don’t envy Miguel his job none, by cripes,” Big Medicine said, as
they drew near the point beyond which the cabin would stand revealed to
them, and for a wonder he spoke softly.</p>

<p>Andy glanced up at the yellow ball floating serenely over the blue ocean
of the sky, down the white-lighted coulee, with fringes of black shadows
here and there, and then at the cabin squatting deserted against the
green background of willows, with blank, staring window and open
doorway.</p>

<p>“If such things can be&#8212;if the ghost of Olafson can come back, he’ll
come to-night and try again to play the wind,” he said solemnly. “Just a
low, even, creepy tone first on open G&#8212;”</p>

<p>They rode slowly around to where they faced the door, pulled up short
fifty feet away from it, and stared.</p>

<p>“<em>There he is!</em>” Andy’s voice was the whisper which carries far.
“He’s <em>come</em>, boys&#8212;to play the wind again! A low, creepy note
on open G&#8212;”</p>

<p>In the doorway, where the moon shone radiantly in, stood a black-clothed
figure topped by a grinning, fleshless skull. Cuddled under the horrid,
bony chin of it was a violin. The right arm was upraised and bent,
poising the bow above the strings. The staring, empty eye sockets were
lighted with a pale, phosphorescent glow.</p>

<p>“Well, by golly!” gulped Slim, in an undertone, and backed his horse a
little involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Aw&#8212;” Happy Jack looked at Irish and Cal, grinned sheepishly, and was silent.</p>

<p>“Go on, Miggie, and git your olives,” Big Medicine murmured. “Twelve
bottles. We’ll wait for yuh here.”</p>

<p>Miguel slid off his horse without a word and started forward, hesitating
a trifle, if the truth were known.</p>

<p>In the doorway the right arm of the figure trembled and moved slowly
upward, pulling the bow lightly across the strings. Came a low, wailing
note on open G, which swelled resonantly in the quiet air, rose a tone,
clung there, and slid eerily down to silence.</p>

<p>Big Medicine started and stared across at Irish, and Cal Emmett, and
Jack Bates, who met his look incredulously. Miguel stopped short and
stood a moment in the blank silence which followed. The gaunt, black
figure bulked huge in the doorway, and the fleshless mouth grinned at
him sardonically.</p>

<p>Miguel took a step or two forward. Again that ghostly arm lifted and
swept the bow across the strings. Again the eerie tones came vibrantly,
sliding up the scale, clinging, and wailing, and falling again to
silence when Miguel stood still.</p>

<p>Big Medicine turned his horse short around, so that he faced those
three&#8212;Cal, Jack Bates, and Irish.</p>

<p>“<em>Say!</em>&#8212;the&#8212;the thing’s <em>playin’</em>, by cripes!” he muttered accusingly,
and edged off fearfully.</p>

<p>“Aw&#8212;say!” Happy Jack moved farther away in sudden, unashamed terror.
“What makes it&#8212;<em>play</em>?”</p>

<p>Miguel stood longer that time, and the silence rasped the nerves of
those who waited farther off. When he moved forward again the playing
began. When he stopped, the ghostly arm was still.</p>

<p>Happy Jack, with an unexpected, inarticulate squawk, kicked his horse in
the ribs and fled down the coulee. Slim went after him, galloping with
elbows flapping wildly. Those who waited longer saw Miguel walk slowly
up to the very threshold, and face the ghost that played over and over
that one, awful strain. They saw him stop as if to gather together his
courage, put down his head as if he were battling a blizzard, and edge
past the unearthly figure.</p>

<p>As he disappeared within, brushing swiftly past the ghost, the strings
twanged ominously. Came an unearthly screech which was like demons
howling as howls the gray wolf before a storm. It raised the hair on
the scalp with that prickling sensation which is so extremely unpleasant,
and it sent Big Medicine, Cal, Jack Bates, and Irish clattering down the
coulee in the wake of Slim and Happy Jack.</p>

<p>Andy Green held his horse and Miguel’s back from following, and
watched them out of sight before he rode closer to the awful thing which
guarded the door.</p>

<p>“All right, boys&#8212;yuh may as well stop the concert; the audience is
halfway home by this time,” he called out, chuckling as he dismounted
and went clanking up to the doorway. “Say, by gracious, yuh done fine!
That last screech was sure a pippin&#8212;it like to have stampeded <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>Pink disentangled his fingers from a fine bit of string and grunted. “It
ought to be. We’ve been practicing that howl, off and on, for four
hours. How was the fiddling, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Outa sight. Say, yuh better take them strings off the bow, and make
darned sure you ain’t having any tracks, or anything. Let ’em come back
and find everything just the way they fixed the plant&#8212;and then let ’em
put in their spare time figuring the thing out, if they can. They’ll
likely come moseying back up here, pretty soon&#8212;all but Happy and
Slim&#8212;so you want to hurry. If you two can beat us home, they’ll never
get wise in a thousand years of hard thinking.” He looked the ghost over
critically, gave a snort, and painstakingly straightened the bow.
“Darned grave robbers,” he exclaimed, looking at the skull. “Well, hike
boys; I hear ’em coming. Got the olives all right, Miguel? Come and get
on your horse. We’ll meet ’em down the trail a ways if we can. And say,”
he called over his shoulder, when he was beside his horse again, “you
fellows do some <em>going</em>! If you ain’t in bed when we get there, the
stuff’s off.” Even while he looked back, Pink and Weary dodged out and
vanished in the gloom of the willows.</p>

<p>The Native Son, bearing in a gunny sack twelve bottles of stuffed
olives, and on his swarthy face an unstudied grin of elation, was just
making ready to mount when Irish and Big Medicine became recognizable in
the moonlight below.</p>

<p>“We thought we’d come back and see if you were alive, anyway,” Irish
announced shamefacedly, with a glance toward the cabin and the spectral
figure in the doorway. “What did it do to yuh, Mig?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only caterwaul like the devil all the time I was getting the
olives. It’s shut up since I came out of the cabin. Seems like it hates
visitors.”</p>

<p>“Er&#8212;did it&#8212;did the ghost make all that noise, honest?” Big Medicine’s
voice had lost some of its blatant assurance. He was bewildered, and he
showed it.</p>

<p>“You heard him sawing on that fiddle, didn’t you? The screeching seemed
to come from&#8212;just all over the room.” Miguel waved his free hand
vaguely. “Just all over at once. Kinda got my goat, for a minute or
two.”</p>

<p>The group rode slowly away, and when Miguel was through speaking they
went in silence. Halfway up the hill, Irish turned in the saddle and
stared down at the roof of the little cabin showing black under the
moon.</p>

<p>“Well&#8212;I’ll&#8212;be&#8212;darned!” he stated slowly and emphatically, and rode
on with the others, who seemed to be thinking deeply.</p>

<p>Their meditations must have been to some purpose, for, after a hasty
word or two snatched in private with his fellow conspirators, Irish set
the pace.</p>

<p>At the stable he did not wait to unsaddle first of all. Instead he went
hurriedly inside, lighted a match, and held it up while he surveyed the
wall where the Happy Family were wont to hang their saddles&#8212;when they
hung them anywhere. Two familiar saddles dangled there, each hanging
upon its accustomed peg by its accustomed right stirrup, proclaiming
silently and unanswerably the fact of their owners’ presence upon the
ranch. When the match flickered and went out, Irish discovered that Cal,
Jack Bates, Big Medicine, and Happy Jack were standing behind him,
staring also.</p>

<p>“Well&#8212;I’ll&#8212;be&#8212;darned!” said Irish again softly, and dropped the stub
with a gesture of keen disappointment.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t them, then,” muttered Big Medicine at his shoulder. “And
the&#8212;the thing&#8212;it <em>played</em>, by cripes!”</p>
